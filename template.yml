parts:
  - id: abstract
    required: true
    description: >
      A good abstract will begin with a short description of the problem being
      addressed, briefly describe the new data or analyses, then briefly states
      the main conclusion(s) and how they are supported and uncertainties.
  - id: acknowledgments
    required: false
    description: >
      Acknowledgments are a simple statement of thanks that appears at the end
      of a manuscript. They can recognize named individuals who contributed
      scientifically to the research of the paper; cite the funding agencies
      that provided financial support for the work; and note the affiliation of
      institutions in the byline. Acknowledgments to people precede those of
      financial support. Acknowledgments may not recognize those who helped in
      preparing the paper; editors who handled the peer review of the paper;
      those who contributed general encouragement (family, friends); or those
      who provided services that were not directly part of the research.
      Acknowledgements may not include a dedication or a memorial. Acknowledge
      positions, titles, and awards only if they provided funding for the
      research and state the source of financial funding in such cases. Noting
      the date associated with an award is not appropriate.

      A major way of displaying authors and affiliations information is to use
      superscripts on the authors and affiliations. It should be mentioned that
      the affiliations for the superscriptaddress are presented and numbered in
      the order that they are encountered.

      The footnote text can either appear at the bottom of a page or as part of
      the bibliography. This option results it in only showing up in the
      bibliography. This can be used to override  the default behavior of the
      journal.

      Specifies whether additional author information such as email or homepage
      are put on the first page or at the start of the bibliography. For
      instance, the prb option puts all such footnotes at the start of the
      bibliography while the prl journal styles displays them on the first page.
      One can override a journal style’s default behavior by specifying
      explicitly the class option bibnotes (puts the footnotes at the start of
      the bibliography) or nobibnotes (puts them on the first page).
